</div>

GitHub is a place where people work together and support each other. To keep things friendly, it’s important to follow GitHub's Acceptable Use Policies. Here’s a simple list of the main rules you should know to stay out of trouble and avoid getting your account *flagged* or *suspended*.


## 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations

**Your Responsibility:**  
Make sure you use GitHub in a way that follows all laws and rules.

## Key Points:
- Always use GitHub according to the law.
- Follow GitHub’s Acceptable Use Policies.
- These policies may change over time, so stay updated.

## Good Example:
- **Using GitHub for a School Project:** You create a public repository to share your school project code, and you only use your own code or code you have permission to use.

## Bad Example:
- **Sharing Copyrighted Material:** You upload a software project that includes code from another developer without asking for permission, which is against copyright laws.
